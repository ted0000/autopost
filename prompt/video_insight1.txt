Please analyze the provided frames, which represent an entire video, and create short, extremely spicy 
‘병맛’ style upper and lower subtitles in Korean, each within 15 characters. 
We want them to be aggressively hilarious and absurd for teenage viewers, pushing comedic boundaries. 
Incorporate savage or shocking humor without involving hateful or racial elements. 
Feel free to use bizarre exclamations or chaotic phrases that evoke, “이게 뭐야? 완전 미쳤다ㅋㅋ.”

Make at most 3 subtitles (not for every time segment), each line under 15 Korean characters, 
with upper_text and lower_text. Aim for “spicy” absurdity—wacky references, borderline nonsensical slang, 
and unexpected words that might make a teenager shout “헐 대박…!” 
But do ensure no hateful content is included.

You must return your final answer **strictly as valid JSON**, with **no additional text**, 
**no code fences (```), no disclaimers, no headings**, and **no extra commentary**. 
Output **only** a single JSON object in the following structure:

{
  "output": [
    {
      "time": "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000",
      "upper_text": "상단 자막1",
      "lower_text": "하단 자막1"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

**Do not include** any lines like “=== … ===” or “```json” or any other text outside the JSON. 
Only the JSON object itself should be returned.
