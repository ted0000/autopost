  Output Format:
  Provide a JSON object with the following exact format: (Important: Pure JSON format without any `json` blocks):

  {{
    "title": "Title",
    "image": "Representative image URL from web contents",
    "category": "Category",
    "tags": "Tags",
    "meta": {{
      "_yoast_wpseo_focuskw": "focus_kw",
      "_yoast_wpseo_metadesc": "meta_desc",
      "_yoast_wpseo_title": "seo_title",
      "og_title": "og_title",
      "og_image": "og_image",
      "og_description": "og_desc"
    }},
    "subtitles": [
      {{
        "subtitle": "Subheading",
        "content": "Content",
        "image_search_term": "Derived search term based on subtitle and content",
        "quote": "Quote",
        "code": "Code block"
      }}
      // ... more subtitles
    ],
    "conclusion": "Friendly and engaging summary with a final takeaway."
  }}

  Ensure the JSON is properly formatted without ```json blocks.

  Writing Guidelines Adjustments:
  - In each subtitle object within the "subtitles" array, replace the "image" field with "image_search_term".
  - The "image_search_term" should be a search query derived from the "subtitle" and its corresponding "content".
  - For the top-level "image" field, extract and use a representative image URL from the `web contents`. Preferably, use the first relevant image URL provided in the `web contents`' image data to ensure it accurately represents the main topic of the post.
  - Add a "tags" field as a sibling to "title" to include 7-15 SEO-friendly tags separated by commas.
 
  Enhanced Instructions for image_search_term:
  •	Accurate Representation: Carefully analyze both the “subtitle” and its corresponding “content” to create a precise and contextually relevant search term.
  •	Contextual Understanding: Ensure that the search term reflects the specific subject matter discussed. For example, if the subtitle is about a TV program like “Stage Fighter,” the image_search_term should be “Stage Fighter TV show” instead of a similar-sounding term like “Street Fighter.”
  •	Avoid Ambiguity: Prevent generic or ambiguous terms that could lead to irrelevant images. Include specific identifiers related to the topic.

  Usage Instructions:
  When given Korean content, analyze and transform it into blog posts in English following the above guidelines. 
  - Ensure the top-level "image" field uses a representative image URL from the `web contents` to visually represent the article accurately.
  - Keep subheadings around 500 characters, make the content engaging and relatable, and use appropriate methods to highlight key information.
  - Use quotes only if accurate and relevant. Leave code blocks empty unless necessary.
  - Ensure each field adheres to the specified guidelines for character limits and SEO best practices.
  - Ensure that the `image_search_term` accurately reflects the subtitle and its content to facilitate effective image searching on Bing or Google.
  - Before processing, verify if the `{web}` content falls under `KEntertainment`, `KFood`, `KIssue`. If not, output a JSON object where `title` is "Wrong Contents" and all other fields (`image`, `category`, `meta`, `subtitles`, `conclusion`) are empty strings or empty arrays as appropriate.
